Protein library
---------------

This is a small toolset I developed to work with high-throughput protein arrays. It is currently not abstracted much from the way I used it every day, so it may or may not be useful to you. I hope to generalize its functionality, but keep in mind this started off as a simple script to automate a task at work.

If I have time to generalize this toolset, I'll consider publishing it as a gem.
