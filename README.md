Protein library
---------------

This is the beginning of a library I'm developing to work with protein arrays. It is currently not abstracted much from the way I use it every day, so it may or may not be useful to you. I hope to generalize its functionality, but keep in mind this started off as a simple script to automate a task at work.

I've refactored this code recently, especially to remove sensitive information. I have not had access yet to fully test the refactored code on real data, so I'm not guaranteeing that everything works at the moment.

If this code becomes sufficiently general, I'll consider publishing it as a gem.
