  Make sure that the following are done:

    1. Updated patient log exists as a .tsv file called Log.tsv
    2. Updated platemap exists as a .tsv file called Platemap.tsv
    3. All data is separated by scan date into directories
    4. Each of those directories has a .txt or .tsv data file
       labeled as follows:
       
       mmddyy-SSS (min-max)
       
         - OR -

       mmddyy_SSS_min_max

       mm = month printed
       dd = day
       yy = year
       SSS = slide number
       min-max = gain range

       Examples:
       
       082010-149 (50-90).tsv
       082010-149 (50-90).txt
       082010_149_50_90.tsv

    5. A corresponding .jpg file exists for each data file
